## Tasks

1. **Implement a Stack**

   - Operations: `Push`, `Pop`, `Max`
   - Each operation must take constant time: `O(c)`

2. **Implement a Queue**

   - Operations: `Push`, `Pop`, `Max`
   - Each operation must take constant time: `O(c)`

3. **Bracket Sequence Checker**
   - Input: A string consisting of brackets of different types: `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`
   - Implement an algorithm to check if the sequence is correct (i.e., each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket)
   - Example:
     - Correct sequences: c, `()()`
     - Incorrect sequences: `[)`, `[(])`
   - The algorithm should have a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string.
