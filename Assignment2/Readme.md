## Tasks

### 1. Fibonacci Number using Recursion

- **Task:** Given a number `n`, print the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion.
- **Questions:**
  - What is the time complexity and auxiliary space complexity of your solution?
  - Can you decrease the time and auxiliary space complexity by using dynamic programming? What would these complexities be then?

### 2. Bob the Postman's Staircase Problem

- **Scenario:** Bob the postman has to deliver mail to the top floor of a tall building. The staircase has `n` steps, and Bob can climb either 1 step or 2 steps at a time.
- **Task:** Find out how many distinct ways Bob can climb to the top of the staircase.
- **Example:**
  - **Input:** `n = 3`
  - **Output:** `3`
  - **Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top:
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
    3. 2 steps + 1 step

### 3. Optimizing Bob's Staircase Algorithm

- **Task:** Optimize Bob's staircase algorithm to meet the following requirements:
  - **Time Complexity:** ùëÇ(ùëõ)
  - **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** ùëÇ(1)
