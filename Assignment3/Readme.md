## Tasks

Bob, the postman, enjoys unwinding by sorting the mail in ascending address-number order when he's not climbing stairs. However, as the postal company expands, Bob finds less time to relax and play Yahtzee. To save time, Bob decides to build UAPB (Ultimate Automatic Postal Bot™), but he needs help programming it!

### 1. Quicksort Algorithm

Write a quicksort algorithm for UAPB that efficiently orders all the mail by address number.

### 2. Fastest Stable Sorting Algorithm

Considering that UAPB can only sort in place due to strange quantum mechanical limitations, determine the fastest stable sorting algorithm on average and explain why.

Bob is so pleased with UAPB that he assigns it a day job at the front desk of the postal office while he delivers mail. Customers can now collect missed mail from UAPB, but there's a problem… UAPB can't search for mail!

### 3. Binary Search Algorithm

Since UAPB is a robot, it naturally prefers binary operations. Implement a binary search algorithm to find the requested mail. Once found, the mail must be removed.

### 4. Binary Search Tree for Package Collection

Bob’s Postal Service has expanded to include package collection. Packages arrive throughout the day and can be picked up randomly. Due to quantum mechanical constraints, UAPB cannot store packages in a list like it does with mail; instead, it must use a binary tree. Implement a Binary Search Tree that allows UAPB to add, remove, and find packages by address number. The tree must remain balanced; otherwise, UAPB might tip over!
